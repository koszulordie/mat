## Welcome to MAT

Find content relevant to the MAT course of the [Masters in Bioinformatics for Health Sciences](https://www.upf.edu/web/bioinformatics).

### Overview

The course will be run in fully remote and partially asynch mode. 

For the asynch part, this means that students will be responsible to watch lecture content elsewhere developing the grounds for each topic. 

We will then meet online at scheduled times to fulfill a few different activities:

- Wrap up main take-homes from asynch lectures
- Q&A
- Solve exemplary exercises
- Run practical tutorials

### Online sessions

Each online session has a required asynch lecture. 

Find the session schedule alongside the topics that will be covered and the tasks required prior to the session.

### Evaluation

Here I will describe how the work of the students will be evaluated
