# Homework

Check the following online content:

1. [Vectors, what even are they? (9:52)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&index=1&t=424s)
2. [Linear combinations, span, and basis vectors (9:59)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7RM-ot2NWY&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&index=2)


# Supplementary Content

1. [A 2020 Vision of Linear Algebra (video series)](https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-010-a-2020-vision-of-linear-algebra-spring-2020/videos). The Linear Algebra part of this course is very much inspired by the 
online lectures taught by Gilbert Strang. This is an ultra-condensed summary of everything that we will cover through 
sessions 1-10. Recommended as wide overview-recap.
2. [Independence, basis and dimension (13:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeMJg4uI7o0).
