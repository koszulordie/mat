# Topics


1. Singular Value Decomposition: $ AV=U \Sigma $. $U$-singular vectors, $V$-singular vectors and singular values.
2. Matrix norms.
3. Low-rank approximation of a matrix: Eckart-Young.
4. Computing SVDs by hand. 
    1. Computing V (right) with an orthonormal eigenbasis of $ A^tA $.
    2. Computing U from V.
5. One-shot reading of a linear map from its SVD: $ N(A) $, $ N(A^t) $, $ C(A) $, $ C(A^t) $.
