# Course Presentation

0. Who is who
1. How things will work during the course
2. What tasks are expected from students
3. How students will be evaluated
4. What we will do during the sessions


# Topics

1. Vectors and vector spaces.
2. Sum of vectors; product of a vector by a scalar.
3. Thinking geometrically: lengths and angles.
4. Linear combinations.
5. Two vector subspace constructions:
   1. Spans: vector subspaces spanned by a collection of vectors
   2. Solution to system of homogeneous equations
6. Linear independence.
7. Basis and dimension of vector spaces.


# Homework

## Before

1. [Vectors, what even are they? (9:52)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&index=1&t=424s)
2. [Linear combinations, span, and basis vectors (9:59)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7RM-ot2NWY&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&index=2)

# Supplementary Content

1. [Last year's notes]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/session-1-20201014.pdf %})
1. [A 2020 Vision of Linear Algebra (video series)](https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-010-a-2020-vision-of-linear-algebra-spring-2020/videos). The Linear Algebra part of this course is very much inspired by the 
online lectures taught by Gilbert Strang. This is an ultra-condensed summary of everything that we will cover through 
sessions 1-10. Recommended as wide overview-recap.
2. [Independence, basis and dimension (13:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeMJg4uI7o0).
3. [Checking linear independence in practice (17:37)](https://en.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/vectors-and-spaces/linear-independence/v/more-on-linear-independence)
