# Tutorial

Tutorial on orthogonal projections onto subspaces ([HTML]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/2-projections_onto_subspaces.html %}),
[Rmd](https://github.com/massonix/math_teaching/blob/master/notebooks/2-projections_onto_subspaces.Rmd))

# Before the tutorial

- Watch the MIT lectures explaining [projections onto subspaces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_Ac6KiQ1t0) and [least squares](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osh80YCg_GM).
- Watch the following Khan Academy videos:
  - [Least squares approximation](https://en.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/alternate-bases/orthogonal-projections/v/linear-algebra-least-squares-approximation)
  - [Another least squares example](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/alternate-bases/orthogonal-projections/v/linear-algebra-another-least-squares-example)
- Read points 2.3 and 3 of the iconic ["Tidy Data"](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) paper by Hadley Wickham.
- Read this article summarising the main points of ["The Grammar of Graphics"](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-grammar-of-graphics-for-effective-visualization-of-multi-dimensional-1f92b4ed4149).

The majority of the reasoning and examples used in this tutorial come from the 4th Chapter of the book ["Introduction to Linear Algebra"](https://math.mit.edu/~gs/linearalgebra/), by Gilbert Strang.
