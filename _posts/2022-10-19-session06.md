# Topics

1. Dot product and orthogonal vectors.
2. Important facts: $ N(A) \perp R(A) $ and $ N(A^t) \perp C(A) $
3. Orthogonal matrices. Main properties: $ Q^t=Q^{-1} $
4. Orthogonal spaces
5. QR decomposition and Gram-Schmidt
6. Orthogonal projection


# Homework

## Before

[Projection matrices and leasts squares (48:04)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osh80YCg_GM).
You might watch this video in full as it is all relevant to the course, particularly for [session 7]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2021-11-03-session07.md %}). In case you do not have a lot of time, you can jump to timestamp <u>36:55</u> directly and watch till the end.
