1. [A 2020 Vision of Linear Algebra (video series)](https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-010-a-2020-vision-of-linear-algebra-spring-2020/videos). The Linear Algebra part of this course is very much inspired by the 
online lectures taught by Gilbert Strang. This is an ultra-condensed summary of everything that we will cover through 
sessions 1-10. Recommended as wide overview-recap.
2. [Independence, basis and dimension (13:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeMJg4uI7o0).
3. [Checking linear independence in practice (17:37)](https://en.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/vectors-and-spaces/linear-independence/v/more-on-linear-independence)
