# Instructions


## Task description

* You will be producing a short video lecture addressed to your peers in which you will present a problem that has been worked out by someone else, and provide a digest of their solution to the problem.

* Below I am proposing you a bunch of papers to work on. You will choose one and work with it for the entire task.

    * These papers borrow a big deal of mathematical techniques and ideas from the two cornerstones of the course: linear algebra and optimization. 

    * They are quite heterogeneous in terms of mathematical scope and accessibility. Please, mind to correctly tune the best balance between your interest in the topic and the difficulty.

    * You can propose papers from outside of the list. But then, please, make sure you agree with the teacher before moving forwards.

* Your main goal is that your audience learns not only about the main findings of the work, but also about the key ideas playing a role behind the solution. In particular, you may not shy away from presenting some level of detail when you feel that they are justified.

* The short video lecture will span no more than 10 minutes and you can present with graphical support such as slides or by making use of a whiteboard. 

* The recommended tool to do so is OBS: [https://obsproject.com/](https://obsproject.com/)

* In your short video lecture you must address the following questions:

    * What is main question addressed in the paper?

    * What is the context and relevance of the question?

    * What is the strategy proposed to answer the question?

    * What are the main ideas behind the proposed solution? Specifically, what are the main mathematical ideas behind the solution?

    * Do these mathematical ideas work as intended? Are there any potential caveats?

    * Have these ideas been tried before in this or a similar context?



## Formal requirements

* You will work individually.

* You must inform the teacher which paper you will be working on: we will do so using a wiki in the Aula Global of the course.

* You are allowed to work on the same paper another colleague is working on. 

* Please, do not read aloud or copy excerpts from the source verbatim.



## Deadline

* 30th December 23:59



## Evaluation criteria

* Clarity

* Sound content, ability to answer the main questions

* Ability to link to topics developed during the course

* Capacity to scrap the literature and validate new knowledge by yourself

* Critical thinking
