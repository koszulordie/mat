# Instructions


## Task description

* Select a paper. Below I am proposing you a bunch of papers to work on.

    * These papers borrow a big deal of mathematical techniques and ideas from the two cornerstones of the course: linear algebra and optimization. 

    * They are quite heterogeneous in terms of mathematical scope and accessibility. Please, mind to correctly tune the best balance between your interest 
in the topic and the mathematical difficulty.

    * You can propose papers from outside of the list. But then, please, agree with the teacher before moving forwards.

* You will be composing a short article addressed to your peers in which you present a problem that has been worked out by someone else, 
and provide a digest of their solution to the problem.

* Your main goal is that your readers learn not only about the main findings of the work, but also about the specific ideas playing a role behind the solution. In particular, you will not be shying away from the details.

* In your article you will be answering the following questions:

    * What is main question addressed in the paper?

    * What is the context and relevance of the question?

    * What is the strategy proposed to answer the question?

    * What are the main ideas behind the proposed solution? What is the novelty?

    * Specifically, what are the main mathematical ideas behind the solution?

    * Why do these mathematical ideas work as intended? What are the potential caveats?

    * Have these ideas been tried before in this or a similar context?

* The document should take about 1000-1500 words.

* Do not copy stuff verbatim

## Working groups

* You may work individually or in pairs.

* You may repeat papers, but make sure to let us know through the aula global task which paper and with whom you will be working.


## Deadline

* 23rd December 23:59



## Scoring system

* Both individual and paired works can reach the maximum score; in particular, co-authors of paired works will get the same score.

* However, the evaluation will be somewhat stricter for paired works, as the overall expected quality
 will be higher and flaws will penalize more.


## Evaluation criteria

* Clarity

* Sound content, ability to answer the main questions

* Ability to link to topics developed during the course

* Capacity to scrap the literature and validate new knowledge by yourself

* Critical thinking

* Tidiness and typesetting quality.
